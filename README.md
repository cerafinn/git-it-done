## Usage

The website allows users to view the public repositories of a user or by the featured language of the repository. The search function queries the GitHub API and returns the repositories associated with the user or language selected along with any open issues of each repository. Clicking on a repository will redirect to a new page for the specific repository with a list of issues, upto 30 issues. Clicking on an issue will then take the user to the specific issue page.
